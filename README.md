This is a single-player version of the classic Pong game built with C++ and the raylib library. One paddle is controlled by the player, while the other is handled by a basic AI opponent. The game is simple but demonstrates core concepts of 2D game development and rule-based AI behavior.

Features Single-player Pong with a CPU-controlled opponent

Smooth paddle and ball movement

Collision detection and scoring

Clean graphics using raylib

AI that follows the ball with speed limitations for fairness

AI Logic The AI uses a simple algorithm to follow the ballâ€™s Y position. It reacts quickly but is limited in speed, making the game beatable and balanced.

Tech Stack Language: C++

Library: raylib (for graphics and input)

Compiler: g++ / MinGW
